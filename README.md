# Car-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard | Excel + Power BI

### This project focuses on analyzing car sales performance for the years 2022–2023 using Excel and Power BI. The objective was to gain insights into sales trends, performance by car body style, color, dealer region, and company-level sales patterns over time.

### The dataset contained 23K records and 16 columns, including details such as car model, price, dealer, customer, sales date, and region. The data was initially cleaned and formatted in Excel, where missing values, blanks, and duplicates were handled to ensure data consistency.

### After data preparation, the cleaned dataset was imported into Power BI to create two interactive dashboards:

#### Overview Dashboard – Showcases visual insights using KPIs, line charts, donut charts, maps, and tables for quick understanding of overall sales performance.
#### Detailed Dashboard – Displays record-level sales details including car ID, date, dealer, company, model, color, total sales, and grand totals for deeper analysis.

### Three main KPIs were created — Total Sales, Average Price, and Cars Sold — each incorporating four time intelligence metrics built using DAX:

#### YTD (Year-to-Date)
#### PYTD (Previous Year-to-Date)
#### YOY (Year-over-Year % change)
#### MTD (Month-to-Date)

### Additionally, a calendar table was created to enable time-based analysis and comparisons. Interactive slicers and filters were added to allow exploration of sales data by month, year, region, and company.

### Skills & Tools Used:
#### Excel (Data Cleaning, Formatting) 
#### Power BI (Dashboard Design, Data Modelling, Time Intelligence) 
#### DAX (YTD, PYTD, YOY, MTD Functions)

### Key Insights:

#### Cleaned and formatted a 23K-row car sales dataset (2022–2023) in Excel to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

#### Built interactive overview and detailed dashboards in Power BI using DAX-based KPIs (YTD, PYTD, YOY, MTD) for total sales, average price, and cars sold.

#### Visualized sales trends by region, company, body style, and color using line, donut, map, and matrix visuals to derive key business insights.
